/**
 * Webview Example
 * 
 * This beginner application demonstrates using a text field to query the web. The layout is
 * also inflated, and a text box added. The button starts a new google search with the search
 * string from the text box.
 * 
 * Possible improvements:
 * + Use a thread to track the loading progress of the webview with getProgress(), and report to a
 *   handler when finished. Could change the button from "Searching..." back to "Lookup".
 * + Add browser controls, such as back, forward, and home.
 * + Use a custom HTML layout that pulls data from a website and displays it in a custom way.
